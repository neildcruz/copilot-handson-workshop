# Getting Started with Copilot Challenges

This project is designed to help you try GitHub Copilot features. Here's how to get started:

## Quick Start

1. Make sure GitHub Copilot is enabled in your VS Code
2. Pick a feature area you want to explore:

- [code-completion/challenges.js](code-completion/challenges.js) - Practice basic code completions
- [copilot-chat/challenges.js](copilot-chat/challenges.js) - Debug and optimize code using Copilot Chat
- [copilot-edits/challenges.js](copilot-edits/challenges.js) - Use `/fix` and `/explain` commands
- [next-suggestions/challenges.js](next-suggestions/challenges.js) - Work with multi-line suggestions

## Specialized Challenges

For the chat participants challenges:
1. Open [use-case-based-challenges/chat-participants/README.md](use-case-based-challenges/chat-participants/README.md)
2. Open Copilot Chat panel in VS Code
3. Try the suggested queries with different participants (@workspace, @vscode, etc.)

For the vision challenge:
1. Open [use-case-based-challenges/vision-challenge/challenge1.html](use-case-based-challenges/vision-challenge/challenge1.html)
2. Use the provided [login-mockup.png](use-case-based-challenges/vision-challenge/login-mockup.png) image
3. Use Copilot Vision to generate code based on the image

Each folder has a README with specific instructions for that challenge type.
