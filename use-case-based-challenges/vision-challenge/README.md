# Copilot Vision Challenges

## Challenge 1: Image Analysis and Code Generation

### Objective
Learn how to use GitHub Copilot Vision to analyze UI mockups or wireframes and generate corresponding code.

### Task
1. Open a UI mockup or wireframe image of a simple webpage/component (e.g., a login form, navigation bar, or product card)
2. Use GitHub Copilot Vision to:
   - Analyze the image
   - Generate the corresponding HTML and CSS code
   - Implement responsive design considerations
   - Add basic interactivity with JavaScript if applicable

### Expected Learning Outcomes
- Understanding how to leverage Copilot Vision for UI development
- Converting visual designs into code efficiently
- Learning best practices for responsive design implementation
- Understanding how to iterate and refine generated code

### Tips
- Try providing additional context in your prompts about specific requirements (e.g., "generate a responsive layout that works on both mobile and desktop")
- Ask Copilot Vision about accessibility considerations for the generated code
- Experiment with different styles of mockups to see how Copilot Vision handles various design complexities

### Evaluation Criteria
- Code quality and structure
- Responsive design implementation
- Accessibility considerations
- Similarity to the original mockup
- Code optimization and best practices

### Sample Prompts
- "Generate HTML and CSS for this login form mockup using modern CSS features"
- "How would you implement this navigation bar to be responsive?"
- "What accessibility improvements would you suggest for this design?"
- "Can you help me implement the hover effects shown in this mockup?"
